\begin{frame}{About Akka}
Akka is an open-source toolkit and runtime simplifying the construction of concurrent
and distributed applications on the JVM. Akka supports multiple programming models
for concurrency, but it emphasizes actor-based concurrency, with inspiration drawn from Erlang.\\~\\

Akka is written in Scala, but provides bindings both for Scala and Java.\\~\\

First public release 0.5 was announced in January of 2010. Current release 2.3.2 (April 2014).

\begin{frame}{Actors Model}
The Actor model adopts the philosophy that everything is an \emph{actor}.  In Akka all \linline{Actor}s
live in \linline{ActorSystem}.\\~\\

Actor can:
\begin{itemize}
\item handle a message from it's mailbox
\item send message to another actors
\item create other actors
\item watch if the child actor is dead and recreate it
\end{itemize}
Actors interacts with each other \strong{only} by sending messages.\\~\\

Actors are executed concurrently.  It allows to run actors not only on different CPUs, but on the
different hosts in the network.
