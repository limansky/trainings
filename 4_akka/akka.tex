\begin{frame}{About Akka}
Akka is an open-source toolkit and runtime simplifying the construction of concurrent
and distributed applications on the JVM. Akka supports multiple programming models
for concurrency, but it emphasizes actor-based concurrency, with inspiration drawn from Erlang.\\~\\

Akka is written in Scala, but provides bindings both for Scala and Java.\\~\\

First public release 0.5 was announced in January of 2010. Current release 2.3.2 (April 2014).
